# rtl8812au

## Realtek 8812AU driver version 5.6.4.2

Only supports 8812AU chipset.

Works fine with 5.3.11 kernel. Source now builds with no warnings or errors.
Compiles correctly also with 5.4.2 kernel.

Added (cosmeticly edited) original Realtek_Changelog.txt, this README.md and dkms.conf.

Added device USB IDs, sorted by ID number.
Added regdb files.

Removed LED control, which was added for driver version 5.2.20

### Building

To build and install module manually:
```sh
$ make
$ sudo make install
```

To use dkms install:

```sh
  (as root, or sudo) copy source folder contents to /usr/src/rtl8812au-5.6.4.2
```

```sh
$ sudo dkms add -m rtl8812au -v 5.6.4.2
$ sudo dkms build -m rtl8812au -v 5.6.4.2
$ sudo dkms install -m rtl8812au -v 5.6.4.2
```

To use dkms uninstall and remove:

```sh
$ sudo dkms remove -m rtl8812au -v 5.6.4.2 --all
```

### NetworkManager

As others have noted, people using NetworkManager need to add this stanza to /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf

```sh
  [device]
  wifi.scan-rand-mac-address=no
```

### Regdb files

If needed, copy the regulatory database files in regdb/ to /lib/firmware/

```sh
$ sudo cp ./regdb/* /lib/firmware/
```
